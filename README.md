# Book-Filter-Android

Use the following endpoint as your data source: GET https://httpapibooks.mocklab.io/books



Implement:
1. The application that downloads these data (from the http endpoint)
2. GUI of the application must contain two filtering criteria (any you like, up to your choice). For example, 'by author' and 'by country' (or any other you like). User must be able to edit specific values, which are filtering data.
3. GUI must have the button, clicking on which new filtering criteria is applied.
4. When filtering criteria is applied, top 3 results must be displayed using the TextView. Total count of results must also be displayed using TextView
5. Criteria must be combined using 'OR' or 'AND' condition - up to you.
